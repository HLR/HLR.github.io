Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models.

We propose a novel end-to-end fine-tuning approach, Probabilistic Constraint Training (PCT), that utilizes probabilistic logical rules as constraints in the fine-tuning phase without relying on these rules in the inference stage. To assess the effectiveness of PCT, we utilize the related corpora and, additionally, create a new and more challenging benchmark that, unlike the previous ones, uses instance-specific rules. Our study demonstrates that PCT improves the transformer-based language model{'}s intrinsic reasoning and makes their probabilistic logical reasoning process more explicit and explainable. Furthermore, PCT equips these models to effectively handle novel situations, including higher reasoning depth, new domains, and complex probabilistic structures.",

We introduce and evaluate the merits of using syntactic information in the multimodal grounding problem.

To explore this, we design various models that disentangle extraction and reasoning(either symbolic or neural) and compare them with state-of-the-art(SOTA) baselines with no explicit design for these parts.

The proposed MetaReVision consists of a retrieval module and a meta-learning module which are designed to incorporate retrieved primitive concepts as supporting set to meta-train visual-language models for grounded compositional concept recognition. Through meta-learning from episodes constructed by the retriever, MetaReVision learns a generic compositional representation that can be fast updated to recognize novel composi tional concepts.

The mentioned landmarks are applicable to multiple targets, thus not distinctive for selecting the target among the candidate viewpoints. To deal with these issues, we design a translator module for the navigation agent to convert the original instructions into easy-to-follow sub-instruction representations at each step. The translator needs to focus on the recognizable and distinctive landmarks based on the agent{'}s visual abilities and the observed visual environment. To achieve this goal, we create a new synthetic sub-instruction dataset and design specific tasks to train the translator and the navigation agent.

We propose a novel graph neural network architecture, called Dynamic Relevance Graph Network (DRGN). DRGN operates on a given KG subgraph based on the question and answers entities and uses the relevance scores between the nodes to establish new edges dynamically for learning node representations in the graph network. This explicit usage of relevance as graph edges has the following advantages, a) the model can exploit the existing relationships, re-scale the node weights, and influence the way the neighborhood nodes{'} representations are aggregated in the KG subgraph, b) It potentially recovers the missing edges in KG that are needed for reasoning. Moreover, as a byproduct, our model improves handling the negative questions due to considering the relevance between the question node and the graph entities. Our proposed approach shows competitive performance on two QA benchmarks, CommonsenseQA and OpenbookQA, compared to the state-of-the-art published results.",

We propose an episode-based cross-attention (EpiCA) network which combines merits of cross-attention mechanism and episode-based training strategy to recognize novel compositional concepts. Firstly, EpiCA bases on cross-attention to correlate conceptvisual information and utilizes the gated pooling layer to build contextualized representations for both images and concepts. The updated representations are used for a more indepth multi-modal relevance calculation for concept recognition. Secondly, a two-phase episode training strategy, especially the ransductive phase, is adopted to utilize unlabeled test examples to alleviate the low-resource learning problem. Experiments on two widelyused zero-shot compositional learning (ZSCL) benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the model compared with recent approaches on both conventional and generalized ZSCL settings.",

Although difficult to achieve from training data alone, it is possible to leverage Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to retain source-language semantic relations in the corresponding target-language translation. The core idea is to use KG entity relations as embedding constraints to improve the mapping from source to target. This paper describes two embedding constraints, both of which employ Entity Linking (EL)---assigning a unique identity to entities---to associate words in training sentences with those in the KG: (1) a monolingual embedding constraint that supports an enhanced semantic representation of the source words through access to relations between entities in a KG; and (2) a bilingual embedding constraint that forces entity relations in the source-language to be carried over to the corresponding entities in the target-language translation. The method is evaluated for English-Spanish translation exploiting Freebase as a source of knowledge. Our experimental results show that exploiting KG information not only decreases the number of unknown words in the translation but also improves translation quality.},

    ABSTRACT = {Flooding is one of the leading threats of natural disasters to human life and property, especially in densely populated urban areas. Rapid and precise extraction of the flooded areas is key to supporting emergency-response planning and providing damage assessment in both spatial and temporal measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology has recently been recognized as an efficient photogrammetry data acquisition platform to quickly deliver high-resolution imagery because of its cost-effectiveness, ability to fly at lower altitudes, and ability to enter a hazardous area. Different image classification methods including SVM (Support Vector Machine) have been used for flood extent mapping. In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in remote sensing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have demonstrated excellent performance on various tasks including image classification, feature extraction, and segmentation. CNNs can learn features automatically from large datasets through the organization of multi-layers of neurons and have the ability to implement nonlinear decision functions. This study investigates the potential of CNN approaches to extract flooded areas from UAV imagery. A VGG-based fully convolutional network (FCN-16s) was used in this research. The model was fine-tuned and a k-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the performance of the model on the new UAV imagery dataset. This approach allowed FCN-16s to be trained on the datasets that contained only one hundred training samples, and resulted in a highly accurate classification. Confusion matrix was calculated to estimate the accuracy of the proposed method. The image segmentation results obtained from FCN-16s were compared from the results obtained from FCN-8s, FCN-32s and SVMs. Experimental results showed that the FCNs could extract flooded areas precisely from UAV images compared to the traditional classifiers such as SVMs. The classification accuracy achieved by FCN-16s, FCN-8s, FCN-32s, and SVM for the water class was 97.52%, 97.8%, 94.20% and 89%, respectively.},

We discuss the way of designing new models in the framework of declarative learning-based programming (DeLBP). The DeLBP framework facilitates combining modalities and representing various data in a unified graph. The learning and inference models exploit the structure of the unified graph as well as the global first order domain constraints beyond the data to predict the semantics which forms a structured meaning representation of the spatial context. Continuous representations are used to relate the various elements of the graph originating from different modalities. We improved over the state-of-the-art results on SpRL.",

    abstract="Spatial information extraction from natural language is important for many applications including geographical information systems, human computer interaction, providing navigational instructions to robots and visualization or text-to-scene conversion. The main obstacles for corpus-based approaches to perform such extractions have been: (a) the lack of an agreement on a unique semantic model for spatial information; (b) the diversity of formal spatial representation models; (c) the gap between the expressiveness of natural language and formal spatial representation models; and consequently, (d) the lack of annotated data on which machine learning can be employed to learn and extract the spatial relations. These items drive the direction of the contributions on which this chapter is built. In this chapter we introduce a spatial annotation scheme built upon the previous research that supports various aspects of spatial semantics, including static and dynamic spatial relations. The annotation scheme is based on the ideas of holistic spatial semantics as well as qualitative spatial reasoning models. Spatial roles, their relations and indicators along with their multiple formal meaning are tagged using the annotation scheme producing a rich spatial language corpus. The goal of building such a corpus is to produce a resource for training the machine learning methods for mapping the language to formal spatial representation models, and to use it as ground-truth data for evaluation.",

    abstract = "We present a novel way for designing complex joint inference and learning models using Saul (Kordjamshidi et al., 2015), a recently-introduced declarative learning-based programming language (DeLBP). We enrich Saul with components that are necessary for a broad range of learning based Natural Language Processing tasks at various levels of granularity. We illustrate these advances using three different, well-known NLP problems, and show how these generic learning and inference modules can directly exploit Saul{'}s graph-based data representation. These properties allow the programmer to easily switch between different model formulations and configurations, and consider various kinds of dependencies and correlations among variables of interest with minimal programming effort. We argue that Saul provides an extremely useful paradigm both for the design of advanced NLP systems and for supporting advanced research in NLP.",

    abstract = "When designing Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications that use Machine Learning (ML) techniques, feature extraction becomes a significant part of the development effort, whether developing a new application or attempting to reproduce results reported for existing NLP tasks. We present EDISON, a Java library of feature generation functions used in a suite of state-of-the-art NLP tools, based on a set of generic NLP data structures. These feature extractors populate simple data structures encoding the extracted features, which the package can also serialize to an intuitive JSON file format that can be easily mapped to formats used by ML packages. EDISON can also be used programmatically with JVM-based (Java/Scala) NLP software to provide the feature extractor input. The collection of feature extractors is organised hierarchically and a simple search interface is provided. In this paper we include examples that demonstrate the versatility and ease-of-use of the EDISON feature extraction suite to show that this can significantly reduce the time spent by developers on feature extraction design for NLP systems. The library is publicly hosted at https://github.com/IllinoisCogComp/illinois-cogcomp-nlp/, and we hope that other NLP researchers will contribute to the set of feature extractors. In this way, the community can help simplify reproduction of published results and the integration of ideas from diverse sources when developing new and improved NLP applications.",
